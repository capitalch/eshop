        Originally there was Capital Watch Company. It used to deal with repairing of watches and photography. Later on it started selling watches also. Soon it became famous for sales and service of watches in Calcutta.

    In 1972 Capital Electronics was formed at the same place in partnership of three brothers Shri Anand Swaroop Agarwal, Shri Krishna Swaroop Agarwal and Shree Rajendra Swaroop Agarwal. The showroom was inaugurated by Shree Ratan Tata. At that time the shop only had Nelco radio and HMT watches. At that time there used to be huge sale of watches and radio.

    The business flourished. At the advent of Black And White TV’s the shop Capital Electronics started to keep TV’s. Soon there came the color TV. This was real boom time for the business. There was less competition and everybody wanted color TV. Soon there were other branches / showrooms of Capital Electronics at VIP Road, Behala, Howrah and Gariahat road of Kolkata.

    In year 1991 the business of Capital Chowringhee was started at the same place by elder son of Shree Krishna Swaroop Agarwal. Later on in year 2005 the business was converted to private limited company. The business boomed but Capital Chowringhee never preferred to expand to multiple branches. There was stiff competition in electronic goods. The company preferred to give emphasis on digital cameras and mobile phones. Off late Capital Chowringhee decided to penetrate in E-Commerce business and they are moving forward to do so.
